# We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.

# While you were busy minoring in gender studies and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence, I was gaining root access to NSA servers.

# I know Gilfoyle probably came in here and puked out a bunch of tech specs, three-fourths of which are total horse-sh*t.

# I hate Richard Hendricks, that little Pied Piper prick.
